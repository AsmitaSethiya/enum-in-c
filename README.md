# enum-in-c


enum is a user defined data type in c.
It is used to assign names to integra; constant values which makes a program easy to read and maintain.

enum TrafficLight {
          RED, YELLOW, GREEN
          
          // by default 0 assign to RED , 1 to YELLOW and 2 to GREEN 
};


we can also customized values like:

enum TrafficLight{
           RED =10, YELLOW, GREEN
           
           // RED = 10, YELLOW = 11, GREEN = 12
};
